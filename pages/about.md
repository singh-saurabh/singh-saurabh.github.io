Hey! I'm Saurabh. It's nice to be here.

Having spent most of my life in Dehradun, I've grown to be a admirer of scenic beauty. I had a majority of my education completed in Dehradun at St. Joseph's Academy. After moving to Hyderabad when I started high school, I continued my education at K.V. 1, Uppal followed by Sri Chaitanaya. After securing a rank of 320 in JEE Advanced, currently I'm a Computer Science student at IIT Roorkee.

My areas of interest include Android Development and A.I. I started coding with Java and C++. Then I worked upon an Android project for a college competition, which was my base for starting Android. Currently I'm working as an Android Developer in Mobile Development Labs, IIT-R. I love to play guitar, which I started playing when I was in 3rd grade. I enjoy reading, be it blogs, novels or non-fiction.
